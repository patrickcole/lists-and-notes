> 1. Compress your images and serve them at correct size
> 2. Minify and compress all your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
> 3. Limit the use of heavy JavaScript. Render as much as you can on the server and use JavaScript to sprinkle on enhancements
> 4. Optimise for the critical path so that your content appears as quickly as possible
> 5. Start familarising yourself with HTTP/2 because that changes so many things
> 6. If you're going to use something like Bootstrap, be sure you remove all the unused CSS in a build process. There's a ton of unnecessary bloat.
