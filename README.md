#### [6 quick things developers can do to improve performance](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/6-quick-things-developers-can-do-improve-performance-111517884) by Tim Kadlec ####
> 1.    Compress your images and serve them at correct size
> 2.    Minify and compress all your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
> 3.    Limit the use of heavy JavaScript. Render as much as you can on the server and use JavaScript to sprinkle on enhancements
> 4.    Optimise for the critical path so that your content appears as quickly as possible
> 5.    Start familarising yourself with HTTP/2 because that changes so many things
> 6.    If you're going to use something like Bootstrap, be sure you remove all the unused CSS in a build process. There's a ton of unnecessary bloat.
